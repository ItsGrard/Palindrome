# Palindrome
I can't get to the solution due to "digit" not changing, so reverse will always be the last number repeated.

There are 2 codes, the first one is mine, the other one is one I found on the Internet that I liked and tried to understand my code basing myself on that one, but I find them both equal...
I think I know what I need to do, I just don't know how to do it.
If anyone can help, thank you.
